### CPSC 120

* Lab 11, Part 2

I really enjoyed the Hi-Lo assignment because I was fun creating game that I got to code, compile, and play. The assignment also provided a valuable hands-on experience in designing and implementing the GameState class for the game. It taught me the importance of class design, as I had to consider the functions and data already given to me and work around them. Debugging compile and runtime errors helped strengthen my problem-solving skills, and completing the unit test was a practical way of testing the correctness of my code. Overall, I enjoyed this assignment because it challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge in a fun way.

* Lab 10, Part 2

I enjoyed this assignment because it was fun learning about two-dimensional vectors in C++. The task involved creating a 2D vector to store Californiaâ€™s county population data and implementing the County Index function to find the location of a specified county in the vector. Additionally, the exercise highlighted the use of command-line arguments and the importance of handling them appropriately. Overall, I enjoyed the assignment as it combined practical application of data structures, modular design, and provided an effective way of understanding programming concepts such as vectors and data structures.

* Lab 6, Part 2

This assignment provided an engaging way to implement a simple yet comprehensive Blackjack scoring program. The assignment primarily focused on validating command-line arguments and handling eros which added a practical aspect to the exercise. I think the modular design of the program, with separate functions for card evaluation and scoring, highlighted the importance of modular programming and code organization. The pre-written functions offered a clean and efficient structure for us to work around and required careful implementation, if you consider the complex rules of Blackjack. The incorporation of input validation, including checking for the correct number of arguments and valid card names, played a crucial role in ensuring the success of my code. Overall, this assignment was both challenging and rewarding, and offered a comprehensive understanding of Blackjack scoring and further enhanced my problem solving skills in a fun way.
